The **Mission Maker Framework** is a modular mission making addon based on the [Olsen Framework](https://github.com/dklollol/Olsen-Framework-Arma-3) designed to help create high quality Arma 3 scenarios utilizing the in game editor and removing the requirement for mission makers to deal with manual editing of script setting files by implementing editor menus and settings for tailoring the mission. Originally designed for [Global Conflicts](https://globalconflicts.net/).
